# Hey, I’m Jordan Segovia Gonzalez

Founder, **BM Private AI (Bright Minds Private AI)** • Harvard AI Student • Software + Hardware Engineer

I build **production grade AI systems** end to end, from model reasoning and data pipelines to secure deployment and ops. Currently pursuing Harvard’s AI Graduate Program while shipping real products.

## 🌟 Featured Project
**MiahAI** — Production grade AI assistant web app  
**Stack:** ASP.NET Core MVC · EF Core · C# · Python · SQL · Modular reasoning & persistent memory  
**Why it matters:** opinionated architecture for maintainable AI assistants (clean separation of reasoning, memory, tools, and UI), with enterprise ready patterns.

- Modular “reasoning units” with composable pipelines  
- Persistent memory layer (EF Core) with clean repository patterns  
- Secure MVC app structure, DI throughout, async/await correctness  
- Ready for containerization & CI/CD
