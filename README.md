## Engineering Capabilities
Clean architecture • performance • reliability 

| Category | What I deliver |
| --- | --- |
| Backend & APIs | Production REST services, typed contracts (gRPC,Protobuf), validation, and stable integration boundaries. |
| Full-Stack Delivery | End to end features across UI & backend, clean layering, and maintainable integration patterns. |
| Data & Persistence | Schema design, migrations, query performance, and reliable persistence for product features. |
| Data Science & Analytics | EDA, statistical analysis, feature engineering, experiment design, and metrics driven insights (Python/pandas/NumPy). |
| AI / ML Systems | LLM features end to end: prompt design, retrieval, evaluations, and model serving, with full ownership from build through production support. |
| Performance / GPU Pipelines | GPU accelerated data processing & ML with RAPIDS (cuDF/cuML/cuGraph) when throughput matters. |
| Hardware / Storage Systems | Storage and system reliability for compute workflows: SMART monitoring, safe eject system, power connection stability, and component-level troubleshooting. |
